# Getting Started

## Learning By Videos

For Those that like watching videos and going through structured courses I would recommend looking at some free courses on one of the following:

* [https://cybrary.it](https://cybrary.it)
* [https://www.hacker101.com/sessions/introduction.html](https://www.hacker101.com/sessions/introduction.html)

## Learning By Practice

For those that like to dive in at the deep end and hope they float. There is only really one resource that is "noob" friendly and that is the complete beginner path from tryhack me:

## Other Resources

Another great place to find help and information is on twitch/youtube. The List below shares InfoSec Streamers that are more than likely to either be learning themselves. Or be more than willing to answer any questions:
